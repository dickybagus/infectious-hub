Welcome to the **Infectious Disease Reference Hub** — a curated and organised repository of essential guidelines, SOPs, manuals, tools, and references for infectious disease programmes.

This site is designed to make widely scattered documents easier to find and use.  
It does **not** rewrite or interpret clinical guidelines. Instead, it provides:

- a **central access point** for national and international references,
- a **clean, searchable index** of programme-specific documents,
- quick summaries to understand **purpose**, **audience**, and **use case**
  for each document,
- and direct links to the **official sources**.

## 🎯 Why This Website Exists

Public health and infectious disease work relies on documents that are often:

- distributed across multiple platforms,  
- shared informally through chats and emails,  
- outdated or replaced without notice,  
- difficult to locate when urgently needed.

This hub provides a **streamlined way** to access up-to-date documents across multiple disease programmes.
