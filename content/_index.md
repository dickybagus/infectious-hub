## Welcome to the **Infectious Disease Program Repository**.

This site serves as a consolidated space for collecting:

- simplified summaries of infectious disease programs,
- key technical concepts,
- and **links to official documents and guidelines** scattered across various sources (WHO, national programs, CDC, journals, etc.).

The main purpose of this repository is to:

> **Reduce the time spent searching across multiple platforms and provide quick access to essential information needed in infectious disease work.**


## 🎯 Scope of the Repository

This repository currently focuses on the following areas:

- **Tuberculosis (TB)**  
  Overview of global and national programs, diagnostic algorithms, ACF/ICF strategies, and key program indicators.

- **ILI–SARI & Respiratory Surveillance**  
  Case definitions, sentinel surveillance design, workflow at health facilities, and laboratory logistics.

- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**  
  Core concepts, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), and resistance surveillance frameworks.

- **Laboratory & Biosafety**  
  Specimen management, biosafety principles, logistics, chain of custody, and laboratory–program coordination.

- **Surveillance & Data**  
  Key indicators, program monitoring, dashboards, and practical approaches to data analysis.

- **Reference Library & Key Documents**  
  A curated collection of links to guidelines, SOPs, technical documents, and useful resources from verified authorities.


## 📚 How to Use This Repository

The structure of this site is designed to be:

- **quick to navigate**, and  
- **flexible**, allowing expansion as programs evolve.

You may use this repository in the following ways:

1. **Navigate through the left sidebar**  
   Each section (TB, ILI–SARI, AMR, Lab, Surveillance, References) contains topic-specific pages.  
   Examples:  
   _“TB → TB Diagnosis”_ or _“Lab → Specimen Handling”_.

2. **Use the search bar**  
   Type keywords like `Xpert`, `ACF`, `ILI`, `biosafety`, `indicators`.

3. **Check the “Links & References” section on each page**  
   Each topic will include curated links to:
   - national guidelines,  
   - WHO/CDC documents,  
   - and other validated resources.  
   This makes the repository a **map to the original authoritative documents**, not a replacement for them.

4. **Treat this site as a quick reference, not a formal source**  
   Summaries here are meant for:
   - reminders,  
   - field notes,  
   - and rapid access during program implementation.  
   For clinical or policy decisions, always refer to the latest official documents.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This repository is **not an official document** of any organization.  
- Content is compiled as **personal and professional working notes** for managing infectious disease programs, surveillance, and laboratory workflows.  
- While every effort is made to ensure accuracy, always confirm:
  - the latest national guidelines,
  - official WHO updates,
  - and local policies and instructions.
